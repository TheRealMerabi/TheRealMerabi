Hello! My name is Ahmad Al Merabi. I go by Merabi and I have a passion in designed websites and games. 

I moved to Canada in 2015 after i got accepted at Carleton University to Major in Communications Engineering. After 5 Years in that degree, I realized that my passion was more
programming related than electronics. I ended up picking Game Development at Algonquin College.

Most of my work is C++ or C# heavy but i always enjoy learning different languages and softwares to add to my skillset!

Here is some of the following languages that i have experience in:

  - C++
  - C#
  - Python
  - Java
  
Some of the following languages I'm trying to learn are:

  - JavaScript
  - Ruby
